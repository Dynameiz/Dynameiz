# `Hello World!`
My name is Hans, I'm a student currently studying at Bina Nusantara University. Currently I am interested in the world of front-end and Internet of Things(IoT).
I also like to teach others about what I can do, which is one of the reason why I became a Lab Assistant at my University.
